Neurodivergency does not mean **disability**.
It only acknowledges the fact that we can be very different.

If you struggle with some aspect of your life while being neurodivergent, please seek help and don't be ashamed by it.

## **Empathy**

<!-- _class: invert -->

## Expand your <span>Empathy</span>

<br/>

<small>

Some people can communicate better through written medias. (Do you really need to have that meeting?)

Some people can be too literal, so try to avoid assuming intentions and prefer to ask directly.

Act mindful on schedule changes, communicate clearly and in advance.

</small>

---

<!-- _class: invert -->

## Expand your <span>Empathy</span>

<br/>

<small>

How can you prevent unnecessary distractions for others around you? Some people have higher sensorial sensitivity.

The person didn't look into your eyes? Maybe that's not about trust or confidence.

</small>

---

### This talk is about <strong>people</strong>

---

If can expand our empathy towards others, 
and undertand that it is not only okay for us to be different. 

It's essential part of our species success.

---

My hope is that one day we won't need to have words to classify people.

First we need to stop assuming people is broken from the start.
